  - **Low-Income Impact**: In low-income areas, a substantial decrease in inflation by -13% suggests significant affordability improvements for essential vegetables, 
      benefiting low-income households.

  - **Middle-Income Stability**: Despite a -4% inflation rate, middle-income areas show potential price stabilization, which could be advantageous for middle-income 
     families.

  - **Higher-Income Trends**: In higher-income areas, a milder decrease in inflation at -2% may have a less pronounced effect on affordability due to greater purchasing 
   power, while overall market trends point towards 
     increased vegetable affordability and stability, though ongoing monitoring is necessary.

  ### Excel Dashboard 📊

### Challenges 🧗‍♂️
- **Dynamic Web Pages**: The websites we scraped were dynamic, featuring elements that loaded asynchronously. Adapting to these changes demanded ongoing adjustments to our scraping code to maintain effectiveness.

- **Data Validation**: Ensuring the accuracy and integrity of the scraped data posed a significant challenge. To address this, we implemented robust validation mechanisms to filter out irrelevant or incorrect information, 
 guaranteeing the reliability of the data collected.

### Conclusion 🎯
The analysis in Noida highlighted price trends and income group preferences, emphasizing the need for tailored strategies to address affordability and diverse consumer needs. It also revealed the potential for rapid-commerce vegetable businesses in Delhi due to the demand for convenient urban delivery services. Overall, the project findings emphasized adaptability to evolving consumer behaviors in Delhi's vegetable market.
